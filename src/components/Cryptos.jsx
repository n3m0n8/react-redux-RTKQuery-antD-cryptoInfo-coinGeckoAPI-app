Too many requestions in a minute perhaps? UPDATE - not related to API limiter/requests... this is something to do with memory state on reloads... its very strange and buggy - sometiems it works on multiple reloads. other times it breaks and i have to tinker the coinspeak arg to the right */{ coinsPeek }) => {

  //const [coins /*, setCryptos*/] = useState(data);  In tutorial,javascriptMastery deployed this useState() method....However, although this worked with his deployment of a custom function that was defined in the RTK Query class (named cryptoAPI in this current effort), it seems pointless... The react documentation says that :" The only argument to the useState() Hook is the initial state. Unlike with classes, the state doesnâ€™t have to be an object." In this case, we don't have a data object that is consistently changing because of what WE are doing... it self-updates the crypto prices/info on the basis of whatever th API is doing.... it's not required to useState- there is only one state for the purposes of hte frontend app, that stat is whatever data state the api info is coming in as. deploying useState crashes the api ... obviously because then there is an expectation that the data container var is to be shifting state...  but it's not shiftin on the frontend of our app, its shifting over there at coinGecko's api.
